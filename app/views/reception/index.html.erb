<h3>Transport</h3>
We will be providing transport from the ceremony venue to the reception, however here are the options should you choose not to use it (or you get lost).
<p>
<strong>By Train</strong> The closest train station is East Dulwich, which is served by National Rail services from London Bridge.
<br>
<strong>By Car</strong> There are no car parks near by, so you might have to chance it with street parking.
<br>
<strong>By Taxi</strong> If you've not used Uber before, <a href="https://www.uber.com/cities/london/">download</a> the app and use code emmab120 to get Â£10 off your first ride.
